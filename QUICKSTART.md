## Usage

### Interactive Mode (Easiest!)

Simply run the CLI without any arguments for an interactive experience:

```bash
python main.py
```

You'll be prompted to:
1. Choose what you want to do (tailor, info, exit)
2. If tailoring:
   - Confirm use of `current_job.txt` (if it has content)
   - Enter company name
   - Enter job title
   - Confirm or change industry (defaults to healthcare)

**Example Interactive Session (First Time):**
```

What would you like to do? [tailor/info/exit] (tailor): tailor

ðŸ“‹ Let's tailor your resume!

```
ðŸŽ¯ Agentic Resume Tailoring System

What would you like to do? [tailor/info/exit] (tailor): tailor

ðŸ“‹ Let's tailor your resume!

ðŸ’¾ Last job: Entry-Level Healthcare Data Analyst at Synergie Systems
Use these details again? [Y/n]: y
âœ… Using cached job details

============================================================
Starting resume tailoring...
============================================================
```

**Note:** The system remembers your last job details, so re-running for the same position is instant!

### Command-Line Mode (Advanced)

You can also use direct commands for automation/scripting:

#### View Industry Information

```bash
python main.py info --industry healthcare
```

#### Tailor a Resume

##### Recommended Workflow: Using `current_job.txt`

The easiest way to tailor resumes is to use the `current_job.txt` file:

1. **Paste job description** into `current_job.txt` (this file is git-ignored)
2. **Run the tailor command:**

```bash
python main.py tailor \
  --job current_job.txt \
  --company "MedTech Solutions" \
  --title "Senior Healthcare Data Analyst"
```

**Note:**
- The `--industry` flag is optional and defaults to `healthcare` (from `.env`)
- You can use `--job` or `--job-text` (both work the same)
- The `current_job.txt` file won't be tracked by git, so you can reuse it for each new job

This will:
1. âœ… Analyze the job posting
2. âœ… Find the best matching base resume
3. âœ… Tailor the resume for the job
4. âœ… Review the tailored resume
5. âœ… Save the result to `resume_pool/tailored_resumes/`

#### Example: Using the sample job posting

```bash
python main.py tailor \
  --job examples/sample_job_posting.txt \
  --company "MedTech Solutions" \
  --title "Senior Healthcare Data Analyst"
```

#### Using a specific base resume

```bash
python main.py tailor \
  --job current_job.txt \
  --company "Company Name" \
  --title "Job Title" \
  --base-resume your_resume_id
```

#### Specifying a different industry

```bash
python main.py tailor \
  --job current_job.txt \
  --company "TechCorp" \
  --title "Software Engineer" \
  --industry tech
```

### Output

The system will generate:
- **Tailored Resume**: `resume_pool/tailored_resumes/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_company.json`
- **Metadata**: `resume_pool/metadata/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_company.json`

The output includes:
- Optimized professional summary
- Enhanced bullet points with metrics
- ATS-optimized keywords
- Aligned skills section
- Quality review score and feedback

## Creating Your Base Resume

### Option 1: Use a PDF (Easiest!)

Simply copy your existing resume PDF into `resume_pool/base_resumes/`:

```bash
cp ~/Documents/my_resume.pdf resume_pool/base_resumes/
```

The system will automatically:
- Extract text from the PDF
- Use Claude to parse it into structured format
- Load it into the resume pool

**Supported:** Any standard resume PDF with readable text.

### Option 2: Use the JSON template

Copy and modify `resume_pool/base_resumes/example_resume.json`:

```bash
cp resume_pool/base_resumes/example_resume.json resume_pool/base_resumes/my_resume.json
```

Then edit `my_resume.json` with your information.

### Option 3: Start from scratch

Create a new JSON file with this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Your Name",
  "email": "your.email@example.com",
  "phone": "(555) 123-4567",
  "professional_summary": "Your current professional summary...",
  "experience": [
    {
      "company": "Company Name",
      "title": "Job Title",
      "start_date": "2020-01",
      "end_date": null,
      "bullets": [
        "Achievement or responsibility 1",
        "Achievement or responsibility 2"
      ],
      "technologies": ["Tech1", "Tech2"]
    }
  ],
  "education": [
    {
      "institution": "University Name",
      "degree": "Degree Name",
      "field_of_study": "Major",
      "graduation_date": "2020-05"
    }
  ],
  "technical_skills": ["Skill 1", "Skill 2"],
  "certifications": ["Cert 1", "Cert 2"]
}
```

See `example_resume.json` for the complete schema.

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Prepare Quality Base Resumes
- Include detailed bullet points with metrics
- List all relevant skills and technologies
- Keep multiple versions for different career paths

### 2. Provide Complete Job Descriptions
- Copy the entire job posting text
- Include requirements, responsibilities, and qualifications
- Don't abbreviate or summarize

### 3. Review and Refine
- The system provides suggestions - review them carefully
- Iterate based on quality review feedback
- Keep what works, refine what doesn't

## Industry Support

Currently supported industries:

- **Healthcare** (`--industry healthcare`)
  - Clinical data analysis
  - Health informatics
  - Healthcare analytics

- **Technology** (`--industry tech`)
  - Software engineering
  - Data engineering
  - Full-stack development

### Adding a New Industry

1. Create `config/industries/your_industry.yaml`
2. Use `healthcare.yaml` or `tech.yaml` as a template
3. Define industry-specific:
   - Terminology and acronyms
   - Skills and categories
   - Keywords and action verbs
   - Certifications

## Troubleshooting

### "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY must be set"
- Make sure you created `.env` file
- Add your API key: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...`

### "No base resumes found in pool"
- Add at least one resume JSON file to `resume_pool/base_resumes/`
- Don't use filenames starting with `example_`

### "Could not parse job analysis response"
- Check that your job description is complete
- Ensure the text file is readable
- Try with the sample job posting first

## What's Next?

- **Experiment** with different job postings
- **Refine** your base resumes based on feedback
- **Build** a library of tailored resumes
- **Track** what works for different roles
