## Usage

### View Industry Information

See what the system knows about an industry:

```bash
python main.py info --industry healthcare
```

### Tailor a Resume

#### Example: Using the sample job posting

```bash
python main.py tailor \
  --job-text examples/sample_job_posting.txt \
  --company "MedTech Solutions" \
  --title "Senior Healthcare Data Analyst" \
  --industry healthcare
```

This will:
1. âœ… Analyze the job posting
2. âœ… Find the best matching base resume
3. âœ… Tailor the resume for the job
4. âœ… Review the tailored resume
5. âœ… Save the result to `resume_pool/tailored_resumes/`

#### Using your own resume

1. Create a JSON file in `resume_pool/base_resumes/` following the format in `example_resume.json`
2. Run the tailor command as shown above

#### Using a specific base resume

```bash
python main.py tailor \
  --job-text path/to/job.txt \
  --company "Company Name" \
  --title "Job Title" \
  --base-resume your_resume_id \
  --industry healthcare
```

### Output

The system will generate:
- **Tailored Resume**: `resume_pool/tailored_resumes/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_company.json`
- **Metadata**: `resume_pool/metadata/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_company.json`

The output includes:
- Optimized professional summary
- Enhanced bullet points with metrics
- ATS-optimized keywords
- Aligned skills section
- Quality review score and feedback

## Creating Your Base Resume

### Option 1: Use the template

Copy and modify `resume_pool/base_resumes/example_resume.json`:

```bash
cp resume_pool/base_resumes/example_resume.json resume_pool/base_resumes/my_resume.json
```

Then edit `my_resume.json` with your information.

### Option 2: Start from scratch

Create a new JSON file with this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Your Name",
  "email": "your.email@example.com",
  "phone": "(555) 123-4567",
  "professional_summary": "Your current professional summary...",
  "experience": [
    {
      "company": "Company Name",
      "title": "Job Title",
      "start_date": "2020-01",
      "end_date": null,
      "bullets": [
        "Achievement or responsibility 1",
        "Achievement or responsibility 2"
      ],
      "technologies": ["Tech1", "Tech2"]
    }
  ],
  "education": [
    {
      "institution": "University Name",
      "degree": "Degree Name",
      "field_of_study": "Major",
      "graduation_date": "2020-05"
    }
  ],
  "technical_skills": ["Skill 1", "Skill 2"],
  "certifications": ["Cert 1", "Cert 2"]
}
```

See `example_resume.json` for the complete schema.

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Prepare Quality Base Resumes
- Include detailed bullet points with metrics
- List all relevant skills and technologies
- Keep multiple versions for different career paths

### 2. Provide Complete Job Descriptions
- Copy the entire job posting text
- Include requirements, responsibilities, and qualifications
- Don't abbreviate or summarize

### 3. Review and Refine
- The system provides suggestions - review them carefully
- Iterate based on quality review feedback
- Keep what works, refine what doesn't

## Industry Support

  - Health informatics
  - Healthcare analytics

- **Technology** (`--industry tech`)
  - Software engineering
  - Data engineering
  - Full-stack development

### Adding a New Industry

1. Create `config/industries/your_industry.yaml`
2. Use `healthcare.yaml` or `tech.yaml` as a template
3. Define industry-specific:
   - Terminology and acronyms
   - Skills and categories
   - Keywords and action verbs
   - Certifications

## Troubleshooting

### "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY must be set"
- Make sure you created `.env` file
- Add your API key: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...`

### "No base resumes found in pool"
- Add at least one resume JSON file to `resume_pool/base_resumes/`
- Don't use filenames starting with `example_`

### "Could not parse job analysis response"
- Check that your job description is complete
- Ensure the text file is readable
- Try with the sample job posting first

## What's Next?

- **Experiment** with different job postings
- **Refine** your base resumes based on feedback
